# Feuermelda - Tech Alchemist & Story Engineer

```diff
+ Building circuits. Writing code. Weaving narratives. Always tinkering.

## About Me
Hi, I'm Feuermelda - a multidisciplinary creator blending tech, storytelling, and a hint of mischief.<br>
I design surreal hardware, code expressive software, and write emotionally resonant fiction.<br>
Right now, I'm focused on leveling up across embedded systems, full-stack dev, and cybersecurity - while turning my ideas into working machines, games, and tales.<br>

I'm all about creativity with precision, and curiosity with depth.

## Currently Building
- **Eelbert** - a servo-powered robotic eel with glowing LED eyes and proximity sensing
- **Melda Counter Mk II** - a green-sensitive Geiger-style device in a custom 3D-printed shell
- **Birthday Bat** - a 3D-printed bat with red LED eyes and a coin cell-powered circuit
- **Mucki & Koda Friendship Game** - a tiny narrative terminal game about two unlikely friends
- **Cigarette Simulator** - an absurd but heartfelt CLI experience that simulates a smoke break
- **AC Remote Hack** - a custom-built Wi-Fi remote for my apartment's air conditioner
- **Cigarette Fairy Lights** - a surreal LED light chain with 3D-printed cigarette shells

## Learning Paths
- **Electric Essence** - practical electronics & soldering
- **Computer Science Foundations** - hardware, networks, systems
- **WebDev with Milk & Eel** - creative frontend webdesign with HTML and CSS
- **JavaScript Speech** - frontend & interactive web
- **RoBotanica** - robotics theory, mechanics, and control
- **Smooth Cryptics** - cryptography and secret-keeping logic
- **Cyber Mayhem 101** - cybersecurity & malware analysis
- **Assembly - Machine Whisperer** - low-level coding and architectural insight
- **Neural Bloom** - machine learning & AI foundations
- **Printed Tinkerings** - 3D printing, physical design, and iterative prototyping

Each path includes hands-on builds, projects, and storytelling elements. I believe in learning by doing (and occasionally breaking things for fun).

## Featured Projects

## Fiction Project: The Block

*The Block* is a literary mosaic of residents in a Soviet-era apartment complex.<br>
Each chapter explores nostalgia, survival, and connection through vivid, character-driven narrative.<br>
It's my way of understanding the quiet dramas of daily life.

 "Sometimes all you need is a quiet courtyard, a broken antenna, and someone who remembers your name."

## Fictional Universe: Milk & Eel Saga
Two beings. One carton. One eel. Infinite chaos.

Milk & Eel is my long-running surreal story & creative universe featuring an anthropomorphic milk carton and a friendly moray eel.<br>
They've battled condiment cults, ghost diners, and vending machine timelines - and they *might* appear in code, too.

It's comedy, lore, cryptography, and cosmic soup - occasionally leaking into my web and programming projects.

## Fun Facts
- I soldered my first custom LED circuit inside a bat-shaped birthday gift
- I can write Python, Bash, JS, Assembly, and Arduino C++
- Sometimes my bash scripts sing
- I ride motorcycles and am not afraid of risks
- My tattoos are black-and-white on one side and full color on the other side of my body
